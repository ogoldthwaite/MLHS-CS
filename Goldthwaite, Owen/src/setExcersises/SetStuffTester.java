/* R 21.1 - It provides methods for add, remove, and contains
 * R 21.4 - Union: make a new set with all values from sets A and B, but both sets must be checked
 * 			for unique elements with contains so that no values are repeated.
 *          Intersection: Use contains to check against each set and then remove any value that does
 *          not appear in both sets.
 * R 21.5 - Union: Same way as above, hopefully. Intersection: Also same way as above, hopefully
